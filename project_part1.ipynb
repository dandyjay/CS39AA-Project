For the purpose of this project, I'm going to limit the scope to just English songs. There may be a deeper correlation that can be made by using all languages, but for readability I chose to limit it to English. This can be easily done by filtering out songs with the `language` tag restricting it to only 'en'.\n",

For example, a song can have the line `[Verse 1: Drake]` that follows before a verse sung by Drake. For the purposes of this project, those lines will remain in the lyrics. They aren't technically lyrics, but the AI can notice patterns with artists and verse/chorus/introduction setups to help classify which genre the song is in.\n"
