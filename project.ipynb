    "This dataset originates from the website 'Genius' where lyrics to songs are posted as well as community-submitted explanations to the meanings behind those lyrics. The dataset has song titles, the full string of lyrics, and a few other columns. However, the column of note this dataset has is a `tag` field which stores which genre each song belongs to. (i.e. rap, pop, rock, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For my project, I would like to train an NLP AI to try to find a connection between lyrics and genre. I'd like to train it to classify the lyrics of a song into which genre they belong to. There is not necessarily any innate connection between these two concepts, which is why I especially want to see how the AI tackles this problem. Perhaps it will be able to find some connection that I am unable to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset has a few problems that need to be addressed before using it for this project. Firstly, this dataset has lyrics from all different languages. For the purpose of this project, I'm going to limit the scope to just English songs. There may be a deeper correlation that can be made by using all languages, but for readability I chose to limit it to English. This can be easily done by filtering out songs using the `language` column restricting it to only 'en'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the lyrics of a song on Genius are split up by verses and choruses and other musical notations separated from the lyrics with brackets. For example, a song can have the line `[Verse 1: Drake]`that follows before a verse sung by Drake. For the purposes of this project, those lines will remain in the lyrics. They aren't technically lyrics, but the AI can notice patterns with artists and verse/chorus/introduction setups to help classify which genre the song is in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Genius allows users to upload lyrics for things that aren't songs as well such as scripts or poems. These are all tagged as 'misc,' but some songs are also tagged as misc. For the sake of simplicity, I will be culling all lyrics tagged as misc from the database even if they are songs."
