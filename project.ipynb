For example, a song can have the line `[Verse 1: Drake]`that follows before a verse sung by Drake. For the purposes of this project, those lines will remain in the lyrics. They aren't technically lyrics, but the AI can notice patterns with artists and verse/chorus/introduction setups to help classify which genre the song is in.\n","\n","Finally, Genius allows users to upload lyrics for things that aren't songs as well such as scripts or poems. These are all tagged as 'misc,' but some songs are also tagged as misc.
