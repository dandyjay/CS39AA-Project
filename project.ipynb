The dataset has song titles, the full string of lyrics, and a few other columns. However, the column of note this dataset has is a `tag` field which stores which genre each song belongs to. (i.e. rap, pop, rock, etc.)\n","\n","For my project, I would like to train an NLP AI to try to find a connection between lyrics and genre. I'd like to train it to classify the lyrics of a song into which genre they belong to. There is not necessarily any innate connection between these two concepts, which is why I especially want to see how the AI tackles this problem. Perhaps it will be able to find some connection that I am unable to see.\n","\n","# Warning:\n","The majority of the lyrics posted on Genius are rap songs. That means theres an astronomically high quantity of swears and slurs. They're important for the trainng of the AI so they have to stay in the data, but I don't condone or personally represent any of the words present in the data."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"3133e6ac","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-11-14T18:46:30.486673Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-11-14T18:46:30.48546Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-11-14T18:51:19.169961Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-11-14T18:51:19.168536Z"},"papermill":{"duration":288.714935,"end_time":"2023-11-14T18:51:19.187994","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-11-14T18:46:30.473059","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>title</th>\n","      <th>tag</th>\n","      <th>artist</th>\n","      <th>year</th>\n","      <th>views</th>\n","      <th>features</th>\n","      <th>lyrics</th>\n","      <th>id</th>\n","      <th>language_cld3</th>\n","      <th>language_ft</th>\n","      <th>language</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>Killa Cam</td>\n","      <td>rap</td>\n","      <td>Cam'ron</td>\n","      <td>2004</td>\n","      <td>173166</td>\n","      <td>{\"Cam\\\\'ron\",\"Opera Steve\"}</td>\n","      <td>[Chorus: Opera Steve &amp; Cam'ron]\\nKilla Cam, Ki...</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>en</td>\n","      <td>en</td>\n","      <td>en</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Can I Live</td>\n","      <td>rap</td>\n","      <td>JAY-Z</td>\n","      <td>1996</td>\n","      <td>468624</td>\n","      <td>{}</td>\n","      <td>[Produced by Irv Gotti]\\n\\n[Intro]\\nYeah, hah,...</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>en</td>\n","      <td>en</td>\n","      <td>en</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Forgive Me Father</td>\n","      <td>rap</td>\n","      <td>Fabolous</td>\n","      <td>2003</td>\n","      <td>4743</td>\n","      <td>{}</td>\n","      <td>Maybe cause I'm eatin\\nAnd these bastards fien...</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>en</td>\n","      <td>en</td>\n","      <td>en</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Down and Out</td>\n","      <td>rap</td>\n","      <td>Cam'ron</td>\n","      <td>2004</td>\n","      <td>144404</td>\n","      <td>{\"Cam\\\\'ron\",\"Kanye West\",\"Syleena Johnson\"}</td>\n","      <td>[Produced by Kanye West and Brian Miller]\\n\\n[...</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>en</td>\n","      <td>en</td>\n","      <td>en</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Fly In</td>\n","      <td>rap</td>\n","      <td>Lil Wayne</td>\n","      <td>2005</td>\n","      <td>78271</td>\n","      <td>{}</td>\n","      <td>[Intro]\\nSo they ask me\\n\"Young boy\\nWhat you ...</td>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","      <td>en</td>\n","      <td>en</td>\n","      <td>en</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5</th>\n","      <td>Lollipop Remix</td>\n","      <td>rap</td>\n","      <td>Lil Wayne</td>\n","      <td>2008</td>\n","      <td>580832</td>\n","      <td>{\"Kanye West\",\"Static Major\"}</td>\n","      <td>[Intro: Lil Wayne]\\nHaha\\nUh-huh\\nNo homo (You...</td>\n","      <td>7</td>\n","      <td>en</td>\n","      <td>en</td>\n","      <td>en</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>6</th>\n","      <td>Im Not You</td>\n","      <td>rap</td>\n","      <td>Clipse</td>\n","      <td>2002</td>\n","      <td>28645</td>\n","      <td>{Jadakiss,\"Styles P\",\"Roscoe P.

Firstly, this dataset has lyrics from all different languages. For the purpose of this project, I'm going to limit the scope to just English songs. There may be a deeper correlation that can be made by using all languages, but for readability I chose to limit it to English. This can be easily done by filtering out songs using the `language` column restricting it to only 'en'.\n","\n","Some of the data entries lack a tag or lack substantial lyrics which would break or confuse the AI so those will also be removed from the database. \n","\n","Additionally, the lyrics of a song on Genius are split up by verses and choruses and other musical notations separated from the lyrics with brackets. For example, a song can have the line `[Verse 1: Drake]`that follows before a verse sung by Drake. For the purposes of this project, those lines will remain in the lyrics. They aren't technically lyrics, but the AI can notice patterns with artists and verse/chorus/introduction setups to help classify which genre the song is in.\n","\n","Finally, Genius allows users to upload lyrics for things that aren't songs as well such as scripts or poems. These are all tagged as 'misc,' but some songs are also tagged as misc. For the sake of simplicity, I will be culling all lyrics tagged as misc from the database even if they are songs, leaving just `rap`, `rb`, `rock`, `pop`, and `country` as the possible genre predictions."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"id":"012893e8","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-11-14T18:51:19.742814Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-11-14T18:51:19.742339Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-11-14T18:51:31.566146Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-11-14T18:51:31.56488Z"},"papermill":{"duration":11.838188,"end_time":"2023-11-14T18:51:31.569246","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-11-14T18:51:19.731058","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["db = (\n","    lyric_database\n","    .loc[lyric_database[\"language\"] == \"en\"]\n","    .loc[lyric_database[\"tag\"] != \"misc\"]\n","    .loc[lyric_database[\"tag\"] != \"\"]\n","    .loc[lyric_database[\"tag\"] != None]\n","    .loc[lyric_database[\"lyrics\"] != None]\n","    .loc[lyric_database[\"lyrics\"] != \"\"]\n","    .loc[lyric_database[\"lyrics\"] != \"[Instrumental]\"] #some songs without lyrics will squeeze\n","                                                       #their way onto the website for no\n","                                                       # discernable reason\n",")\n","db = db.sort_values(by=\"id\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"20100ff4","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.008713,"end_time":"2023-11-14T18:51:31.587092","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-11-14T18:51:31.578379","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["This dataset has several columns that can be used for all sorts of implementation.

Likely the top word is going to be \"`\\n`\" as it is the 'word' that separates lines in the lyrics, so we will be excluding these in our search. Symbols like brackets and parentheses are also likely to be common with the way we split it up in the previous cells, so we will also be ignoring those. Stop words are also bound to be extremely common, so we will be defining a list of common stop words to ignore.

interesting to see how high love is at the top of the list of words. A lot of songs are about love, whether it be for a person or any other thing worth being passionate about. Action words like \"go\" and \"get\" and \"got\" are also very high on the list which makes sense especially since a lot of rap songs are about wealth and possession. I'm also surprised to see that the stop word \"I'm\" was so common that it even made a re-appearance with the incorrect symbol as the apostrophe.
