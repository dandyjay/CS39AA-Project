# CS39AA-Project

In this project I use NLP and machine learning to try to predict a song's genre based on its lyrics. The project uses [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlosgdcj/genius-song-lyrics-with-language-information) public database. The project was done in 3 parts (named rather poorly):
- Part 1: Data cleansing and analysis [found on project.ipynb](project.ipynb)
- Part 2: Training a machine learning model [found on project_2.ipynb](project-part2.ipynb)
- Part 3: Training an existing deep learning model [found on project_3.ipynb](project_part_3.ipynb)

This was a project done for my class CS 39AA, "NLP and Deep Learning AI"
