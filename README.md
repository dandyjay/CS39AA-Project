# CS39AA-Project

In this project I use NLP and machine learning to try to predict a song's genre based on its lyrics. The project was done in 3 parts:
- Part 1: Data cleansing and analysis
- Part 2: Training a machine learning model
- Part 3: Training an existing deep learning model
This was a project done for my class CS 39AA, "NLP and Deep Learning AI"
